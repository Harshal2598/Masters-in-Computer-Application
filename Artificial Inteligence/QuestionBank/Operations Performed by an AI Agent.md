# 🤖 Operations Performed by an AI Agent

An **AI agent** is any system that can *perceive* its environment, *process* information, and *take actions* to achieve a goal.  
To perform intelligent behavior, an AI agent goes through several key operations.

Below are the **main operations performed by an AI agent**:

---

## 1. **Perception (Sensing)**
The agent collects information from the environment using **sensors**.

### Examples:
- A self-driving car uses cameras and radar.
- A chatbot reads user text input.
- A robot uses proximity sensors.

---

## 2. **State Representation**
The agent converts raw sensor data into a meaningful **internal representation** of the world.

### Examples:
- A chess agent stores the board position.
- A robot maps the room layout.
- A medical AI stores patient health data.

---

## 3. **Goal Formulation**
The agent identifies what it must achieve.

### Examples:
- A vacuum robot → Clean the room.
- A GPS system → Find shortest path.
- A trading AI → Maximize profit.

---

## 4. **Planning / Decision Making**
The agent decides the **best action** by evaluating alternatives.

### Methods used:
- Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*)
- Optimization algorithms
- Rule-based reasoning

### Example:
A self-driving car plans a safe route through traffic.

---

## 5. **Action Selection**
The agent chooses the **most suitable action** at each step.

### Example:
- Turn left  
- Increase speed  
- Move arm forward  

---

## 6. **Action Execution (Using Actuators)**
The agent performs the selected action in the environment using **actuators**.

### Examples:
- Robot motors move wheels.
- AI software executes commands.
- Car accelerates or brakes.

---

## 7. **Learning from Experience**
The agent improves its behavior using past experiences (Machine Learning).

### Examples:
- Chatbots learn from user interactions.
- Self-driving cars learn road patterns.
- Game AI improves by playing many games.

---

## 8. **Performance Evaluation**
The agent checks if it is achieving the desired goal.

### Examples:
- Did the robot clean the room completely?
- Did the path planner find the shortest route?
- Did the recommendation system increase accuracy?

# 📝 **Short Exam Answer**

Operations performed by an AI agent include:

1. **Perception:** Collecting input from the environment.  
2. **State Representation:** Building an internal model of the environment.  
3. **Goal Formulation:** Understanding what objective to achieve.  
4. **Planning/Decision Making:** Choosing the best action.  
5. **Action Selection & Execution:** Acting using actuators.  
6. **Learning:** Improving from experience.  
7. **Performance Evaluation:** Checking success and adjusting behavior.

These operations enable an AI agent to act intelligently and autonomously.
