📘 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.
AI systems can learn, think, make decisions, and solve problems by analyzing data.

Examples of AI include virtual assistants, self-driving cars, chatbots, and recommendation systems.
