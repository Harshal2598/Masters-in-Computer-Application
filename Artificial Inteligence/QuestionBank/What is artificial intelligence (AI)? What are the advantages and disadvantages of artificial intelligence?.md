What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that enables machines to think, learn, and make decisions like humans.
AI systems analyze data, recognize patterns, solve problems, and perform tasks that normally require human intelligence—such as understanding language, learning from experience, or making predictions.

Short Definition:
AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that require human-like intelligence.

Advantages of Artificial Intelligence
1. Automation

AI can automate repetitive tasks, which increases speed and reduces human effort.

2. High Accuracy

AI systems can analyze large amounts of data with minimal errors (e.g., medical diagnosis, weather prediction).

3. 24/7 Availability

Machines do not need breaks, sleep, or holidays.

4. Saves Time and Cost

AI speeds up processes and reduces operational costs.

5. Handles Complex Tasks

AI can perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans (e.g., space research, disaster rescue robots).

6. Better Decision Making

AI can analyze big data and provide insights for smarter decisions.

Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence
1. High Cost of Development

Building and maintaining AI systems is expensive.

2. Unemployment

Automation can replace some human jobs.

3. Lack of Creativity

AI can only follow data and rules—cannot think creatively like humans.

4. No Human Emotions

AI cannot replace human empathy, judgment, or social understanding.

5. Data Dependency

AI needs a large amount of quality data; wrong data can lead to wrong decisions.

6. Security Risks

AI systems can be hacked or misused (e.g., fake videos, cyberattacks).
